Application Entrypoint
----------------------
This module bootstraps the FastAPI application using the factory pattern.

Key responsibilities:
    - Initialize structured logging for consistent output (JSON format).
    - Configure the FastAPI app with metadata (title, description, version, contact).
    - Register all API routers (auth, ingest, analytics, health, comments).
    - Expose an ASGI `app` instance for Uvicorn/Gunicorn.

Related modules:
    - app/core/logging.py ‚Üí initializes structured logging.
    - app/api/routes/* ‚Üí defines all API endpoints.
    - app/tasks/celery_app.py ‚Üí Celery integration (workers, warmup tasks).
